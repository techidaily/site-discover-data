It is tough to get a refund after you’ve already paid for the products on online shops. It’s virtually impossible to get your money back. However, here are a few things you can do after being victimized:

* Collect all evidence available. It includes email receipts, transaction numbers, and photos of the products.
* Report to the online shopping platform. Some online shops don’t sell directly to you. They allow sellers on their websites to sell products. Report the incident through their email or phone lines. They might not be able to refund you fully. But, they can at least suspend the culprit.
* Give a heads up to your bank. Let your bank know to watch out for questionable activities in your account.
* Report the incident to consumer watch. Your government may have agencies where you can report such incidents. American citizens can contact the FTC. Canada has the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. The UK has ActionFraud. And Australians can report to ScamWatch.
